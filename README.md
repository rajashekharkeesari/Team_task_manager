## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or above)
- MongoDB (running locally or MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Team_task_manager
```

### 2. Setup Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a .env file inside server/ (optional):

```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/team_task_manager
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will run on http://localhost:5000

### 3. Setup Frontend

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd client

## Deployment

This application is configured to have its frontend deployed on Vercel and its backend on Render:

### 1. Backend Deployment (Render)
1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Create an account on [Render](https://render.com/) and add a new **Web Service**.
3. Connect your GitHub repository and set the **Root Directory** to `server`.
4. Use `npm install` for the Build Command and `node server.js` for the Start Command.
5. Add your Environment Variables (`MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLIENT_URL` pointing to Vercel, etc.).
6. Deploy and copy the Render URL.

### 2. Frontend Deployment (Vercel)
1. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and add a new project.
2. Import your GitHub repository and set the **Root Directory** to `client`.
3. Vercel should auto-detect **Vite** as the framework.
4. Add the `VITE_API_URL` environment variable pointing to your deployed Render backend URL.
5. Deploy the application.
